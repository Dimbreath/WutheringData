What the chimpanzee was holding in his hand was exactly what the plantain plant named XXX looked like in the image documents. It was recorded that this fruit, popular among both young and old, had been widely cultivated before the Lament.\nHowever, as a triploid plant, XXX, like most cash crop plants that require breeding techniques, disappeared after the Lament. Information about this fragile species can now be found in some historical literature.\nAlthough regretable this is also the natural law of succession. According to Verina's law, stagnation is one of the most important factors of biological extinction, and this is the inevitable end of XXX in the wild, which has been artificially deprived of its ability to reproduce.",

  "4": "Guided by the XXX and the sounds of the plant, I came to this stunningly beautiful large tree with purple branches and leaves.\nJudging from the shape of the leaves, it is possible that this plant is a subspecies of Ficus arborvitae. However, the origin of the wonderful purple color on the leaves is unknown, and further research is needed to verify it.\nThe large tree is perennially cooped up with parenting female orangutans underneath, which makes them sensitive and rabid. To avoid a head-on confrontation, I plucked a large amount of gorilla hair through days of collecting and making it a coat. By such means, I took and effort to get close enough to the big tree and collected samples of some of the leaves.\nHowever, because of the season, no samples of the flowers as well as the fruits of the species were collected, and no pollinating insects were seen in the vicinity. There are still many mysteries to be revealed.\nBut I am sure that this is the first time this species is discovered. I tentatively named it XXX and made an appointment with it to come back sometime to hear its story of more than a century.\nGoodbye, XXX and I'll see you again when the season is right.",

Its presence seemed to indicate the infinite power of life, and I and Xxx were attracted by its vitality like then afternoon sun. We were involuntarily leaping and cheering.\nBut the closer we get to the tree, the more anxious the plants sound. Even the duckweed beneath the feet are making strange noises.\nI rarely find this phenomenon outside the radiation range of Tacet Fields. Finding the source of this phenomenon may be lead to the reason why the trees throughout the Dim Forest, both the Confinement Woods and the Xxx just now are so huge.\nSo what am I waiting for? It's better to get up and go now than to sit and talk!",

It was the first time I saw such a persistent TD, which started to chase as if really enraged. It chased me from the Confinement Woods all the way here before I could get rid of it.\n\nBut this is already near the Tacet Field, with soil barren and the plants left with only sounds of pain. There is nothing I can do for plants in this state. I have to cheer up! Decay and extinction are also part of ecology. Nature is not always gentle, and it is my duty to detect and witness it.",

  "10": "The environment of the Confinement Woods is even more magical than expected. A unique canopy ecosystem has formed around the branches of this giant tree.\nAccording to my investigation, the tree's branches contain abundant Resonance Energy within. The energy gathered from around the area of the Dim Forest travels from the top of the tree to the entire trunk. Under the catalyst of this energy, such a huge tree was formed. And it is by relying on these energies that the tree reproduces a whole different ecosystem. Probably because of the ferocious roars that come from time to time within the tree, the tree has no signs of activity from large MO or TD. This gives the plants a better chance to flourish and allows the Remnant Mutterfly to exist.\nThe skills of the Resonator who created this giant tree is very similar to mine. I guess he is also a nature lover. Otherwise, even with the assistance of the sonic instrument at the top of the tree, it is unlikely that such a large and complex giant tree could have been created.\nIn order to facilitate future expeditions, I made a little fluorescent decoration on the branch of Confinement Woods as a sign. This will make future research expeditions more efficient. So it's time to go, to explore the depths of the Confinement Woods!",

Members are as follows:\nSpecial Operations Company, Vanguard Battalion, Huanglong Midnight Rangers Regiment (111162)\nGeological Exploration Team, Huaglong Academy\n......\nAnalysis of Results Regarding the Investigation of the Unknown Fog:\nThis exploration collected samples of the mists in the tunnel connecting the Hukou Mine and the Hazy Depths, and analyzed them in the field using the [Simple Spectrometer] carried by the team. Based on the results of this test, we speculate that the mist appears to be a biological component, with a composition similar to the scale powder on the wings of lepidopteran insects, showing non-toxic, low-temperature properties.\nWe infer that the danger of the mists come from its low temperature:\n①\tCondensation of water vapor due to low temperatures can greatly impede vision and cause investigators to lose judgment of direction in the foggy area.\n②\tLow temperatures can directly affect the health status of investigators, prolonged hypothermia leads to reduced physical vitality and the inability to respond to hazards in a timely manner.\nHowever, our current investigation has not yet identified the anomalous sound coming from within the fogs proper, and considering that the unknown sound may lead to panic among the people nearby and affect the operations of the mine, it is recommended that the above information be withheld from the public.\n\nBelow is the personnel missing recently:\nChameng\nKuopu\nLeyun\nSongning\n......\n(Relatives to these persons experienced imaginary voices to various degrees.
