  "1542": "Danjin",

  "1558": "Yangyang",
  "1559": "The voices Danjin and the others are hearing, is it because of the fog?",
  "1560": "Taoqi",
  "1561": "There is no conclusive evidence to prove this yet, but many share the speculations. It is natural for people to be afraid of the unknown. It's just that these discussions have already affected normal operations of the mine.",
  "1562": "Taoqi",
  "1563": "With the Crownless's resurrection imminent, the supply of Tacetite must be maintained at all costs.",
  "1564": "This issue must be resolved as soon as possbile.",
  "1565": "Taoqi",
  "1566": "An on-site investigation of the mining sites is needed, it'll provide you with more findings. If you manage to collect some samples of the fog, I can help you reach the Academy for an analysis.",
  "1567": "Danjin",
